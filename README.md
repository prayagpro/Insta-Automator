# Instagram Automation Bot ü§ñ

A simple bot designed to log in to Instagram and follow specific accounts programmatically. This project explores the challenges and potential solutions for automating tasks on Instagram.

## üöÄ Features

- **Login Automation:** Automatically log in to Instagram using user credentials.
- **Follow Automation:** Programmatically follow specific Instagram accounts.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

1. **Automation Restrictions:**  
   Instagram detected bot-like activities, leading to account verification and temporary action blocks.

2. **Security Measures:**  
   Instagram flagged the bot for violating its Terms of Service, limiting automation capabilities.

3. **CAPTCHA Challenges:**  
   The bot encountered CAPTCHA prompts that required manual intervention.

## üìö Lessons Learned

- **Strict Anti-Bot Policies:** Instagram enforces rigorous measures to protect platform integrity.
- **Human Behavior Simulation:** Mimicking human-like delays and random actions is essential for avoiding detection.
- **Official APIs:** Using the [Instagram Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/) is safer and ensures compliance with Instagram's policies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

- **Human-Like Behavior:**  
  Introduce random delays and actions to better simulate human interactions.
  
- **Official API Usage:**  
  Explore the Instagram Graph API for compliant and reliable automation.

- **Proxy Integration:**  
  Use secure proxies to avoid IP-based restrictions and bans.
