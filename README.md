InstaBot Automation Project

This project demonstrates an attempt to create a simple Instagram automation bot using the instabot library. The bot performs basic tasks such as logging into an account and following specified users.

üöÄ Features
	‚Ä¢	Log in to Instagram with user credentials.
	‚Ä¢	Programmatically follow specific Instagram accounts.

‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced
	1.	Automation Restrictions: Instagram detected bot-like activities, leading to account verification and action blocks.
	2.	Security Measures: Instagram flagged the bot as violating its Terms of Service.
	3.	CAPTCHA Challenges: The bot encountered CAPTCHA prompts requiring manual intervention.

üìö Lessons Learned
	‚Ä¢	Instagram enforces strict anti-bot policies to ensure platform integrity.
	‚Ä¢	Mimicking human behavior (e.g., delays, randomization) is crucial for successful automation.
	‚Ä¢	Official APIs, like the Instagram Graph API, are safer for automation within policy limits.

üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements
	‚Ä¢	Introduce random delays and actions to better simulate human behavior.
	‚Ä¢	Explore Instagram‚Äôs official API for compliant and reliable automation.
	‚Ä¢	Use secure proxies to avoid IP-based restrictions.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
